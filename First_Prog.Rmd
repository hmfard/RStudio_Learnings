## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r test}
fzero <- function(func=f, initial = c(0,1)){
  a <- initial[1]
  b <- initial[2]
  if( f(a)*f(b)>0) error("The function has no root in this interval")
  if(f(a)*f(b)==0) return(ifelse(f(a)!=0,b,a))
  return((a+b)/2);
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
